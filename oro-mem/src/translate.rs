//! Memory address translation system. Used globally.

// NOTE(qix-): This module implements a very simplistic module offset
// NOTE(qix-): calculation that might be considered by some to be
// NOTE(qix-): both rudimentary and bad practice.
// NOTE(qix-):
// NOTE(qix-): You wouldn't be wrong for thinking so. However, I'm writing
// NOTE(qix-): this as a sort of historic note to more or less justify
// NOTE(qix-): my decision.
// NOTE(qix-):
// NOTE(qix-): This module used to be complex. In fact the first iteration of
// NOTE(qix-): this system didn't even require that the memory was linear
// NOTE(qix-): mapped, just that a stable physical->virtual translation
// NOTE(qix-): was possible.
// NOTE(qix-):
// NOTE(qix-): It was very overengineered; PAT (phys-addr translation) generics
// NOTE(qix-): were passed around _everywhere_. Getting them from the architectures
// NOTE(qix-): was a nightmare, const generic limitations caused a ton of issues
// NOTE(qix-): and resulted in a bunch of hacks, and as the kernel began to grow
// NOTE(qix-): and evolve, the ergonomics really slowed things down.
// NOTE(qix-):
// NOTE(qix-): Further, as the first few architectures started to flesh out,
// NOTE(qix-): and as more research was done on other architectures, it was clear
// NOTE(qix-): that a linear map would be the defacto way for 64-bit architectures
// NOTE(qix-): to access physical memory. Obviously this won't scale to 32-bit
// NOTE(qix-): architectures but for the first version of the kernel this should
// NOTE(qix-): be sufficient. Given that the kernel is so small compared to
// NOTE(qix-): other mainstream OSes, the goal is to be able to work this
// NOTE(qix-): into a better system in the future without the need for massive
// NOTE(qix-): refactors.
// NOTE(qix-):
// NOTE(qix-): Thus the removal of the generics that were scattered everywhere
// NOTE(qix-): began, and I implemented a less complex but equally as clever
// NOTE(qix-): solution that involved proc macros and extern linked functions
// NOTE(qix-): to model something akin to Rust's own global allocator attribute,
// NOTE(qix-): with the goal of re-using that system for e.g. the global page frame
// NOTE(qix-): allocator, etc.
// NOTE(qix-):
// NOTE(qix-): However, as time went on it was clear _that_ wouldn't work either,
// NOTE(qix-): as the mapping APIs were re-used for early boot-stage PFA variants
// NOTE(qix-): that needed a different way of accessing/marking memory before
// NOTE(qix-): memory was linear mapped, and other solutions such as an enum-switched
// NOTE(qix-): global PFA depending on the boot stage introducing a dynamic dispatch
// NOTE(qix-): or `match` branch seemed like an unacceptably slow solution.
// NOTE(qix-):
// NOTE(qix-): So for now, this is the lowest resistance solution that of course only
// NOTE(qix-): works on 64-bit systems whereby a linear map is possible, which
// NOTE(qix-): will at least get the project to v0 and not convolute the APIs
// NOTE(qix-): so much except for points where translation is really necessary,
// NOTE(qix-): keeping things simple until the time a more complex physical memory
// NOTE(qix-): access layer is necessary.
// NOTE(qix-):
// NOTE(qix-): So, like I said, this is actually the refined and evolved, conscious
// NOTE(qix-): evolution of this subsystem, despite it being simplistic.
