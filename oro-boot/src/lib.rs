//! Boot routine for the Oro kernel.
//!
//! This crate is intended to be used by bootloaders
//! to boot into the Oro kernel via a standardized
//! and safe interface.
//!
//! The role of a bootloader implementation in Oro is to ultimately
//! call this function with a proper configuration, which
//! provides a clean and standardized way of initializing and booting
//! into the Oro kernel without needing to know the specifics of the
//! kernel's initialization process.
//!
//! This crate is not strictly necessary to boot the Oro kernel, but
//! provides a known-good way to do so.

	/// For all bootloader reclaimable regions, set the type to `Usable` as well,
	/// but set the `used` property to the number of bytes in the region.
	///
	/// If the bootloader has used only part of a region, set the `used` field to
	/// the number of bytes used.

	/// ignored by the PFA and kernel).
