/// A singular ring.
///
/// Rings are collections of [`crate::instance::Instance`]s.
/// They also form the primary security boundary in the Oro ecosystem.
///
/// Module instances are mounted onto rings, allowing the instances to
/// see all other instances on the ring, as well as child rings.
///
/// However, module instances on a ring cannot see 'sibling' or parent
/// rings, or anything on them, under any circumstance. This is enforced
/// by the kernel. The resources they have access to are limited to those
/// explicitly granted to them by the parent ring via [`crate::interface::Interface`]s.
///
/// Rings have exactly one parent ring, and can have any number of child
/// rings. The root ring is the only ring that has no parent ring, and is
/// spawned by the kernel itself. Any boot module instances put onto
/// the root ring are effectively at the highest privilege level of the
/// system, and can interact with the kernel directly. Child rings may
/// only do so if one of the root ring's module instances has granted
/// them such access via a port or interface.
